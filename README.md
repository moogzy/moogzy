ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he, him, his

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that fit any of the following themes:

* Network Operating Systems (e.g protocol applications, security features).
* Network Operations and Automation.
* Declarative configuration management tools.

However, I tend to dip my fingers into anything interesting and especially if I uncover a bug!
